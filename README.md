 What's Inside?

 1. Importing Libraries and Data
We begin by importing essential libraries such as TensorFlow and Matplotlib. The CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.

 2. Data Visualization
Visualizing the data is crucial for understanding the problem at hand. You'll get a glimpse of the first 25 images from the dataset along with their corresponding class labels.

 3. Building the CNN Model
The core of this notebook lies in constructing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification. You'll learn how to define layers such as Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, and Dense, creating a powerful architecture capable of learning intricate patterns from images.

 4. Compiling and Training the Model
With the model architecture in place, it's time to compile it by specifying the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics. The model is then trained on the training dataset, with performance monitored on the validation set.

 5. Evaluating Model Performance
After training, you'll evaluate the trained model's performance on the test dataset to assess its accuracy in classifying unseen images. Both accuracy and loss curves are visualized to understand the model's training progress.
